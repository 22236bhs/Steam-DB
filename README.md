The json file "data.json" is not included in the github repository because it contains my Steam API key and my steam id. The format for the json file is {"api_key": "key", "steam_id": "id"} where "key" is replaced with the Steam API key in string form and "id" is replaced with a steam id in string form.

The interface options that CAN be used without a connection to steam is option 1, 2, 3, 6.
